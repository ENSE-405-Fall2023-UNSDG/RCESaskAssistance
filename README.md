# About this Project:
This project aims to help the RCESaskatchewan community, a community that deals with trying to
educate the local region of Saskatchewan on sustainable development as it relates to the united nationsâ€™
17 goals for sustainable development. One component of educating people on sustainable development in
Saskatchewan is making them see that there is opportunity in Saskatchewan for sustainable development.
The way that is thought to do this is through displaying the sustainable development projects going on in
Saskatchewan that are recognized by RCESaskatchewan, as they do yearly a recognition award for
sustainable developments in the province. These projects can be displayed for visitors of the
RCESaskatchewan website to engage with.
